<p>For the exhibition <a href="https://www.vanettengallery.com/jiskahuizing" target="_blank">Disobedient Buildings</a> at gallery <i>Van Etten</i>, Huizing has developed a series of site specific sound pieces at Enerhaugen.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2021, they've explored the Enerhaugen neighborhood both through their own research and taking the multidisciplinary, anthropological research 'Disobedient Buildings' as a starting point.</p>
<p><em>Disobedient Buildings</em> is a multi-sited research project about housing, welfare and wellbeing based at the Institute
  of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Enerhaugen is one of its research sites and with the participants'
  consent, Huizing has gotten acces to a selection of research materials as a starting point for this sound project.</p>
<p>The project has resulted in a series of sound works: <i>Torn Tracks #21-24: Disobedient Buildings</i>, which are accompanied by a booklet.</p>
