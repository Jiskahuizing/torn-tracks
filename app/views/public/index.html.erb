<p style="color:#ccffcc";><strong><ins>FEATURED TRACK:</ins></strong> <a href="http://www.torntracks.com/stop_maps">Torn Tracks #19 - Bergen (12-17 July 2019)</a><br></p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vestlandsutstillingen/" target="_blank">Vestlandsutstillingen 2019</a>, Huizing is developing 6 site specific sound pieces for exhibitions in
  Ålesund, Haugesund, Øystese, Stavanger, Førde and Bergen.</p>
<p>Between 12-17 July 2019, she went on a site visit to Bergen to explore and record material for a
  new sound piece, the last one of this series of six. <em>Torn Tracks #19 - Bergen (12-17 July 2019)</em> premieres on
  the opening of the Vestlands exhibition at Kunstgarasjen in Bergen, on the 10th of October and is now available on the
  Torn Tracks website.</p>
<p><i>"The experience of Huizing's visit to Bergen was very different than the other 5 ones, because she has lived in
  Bergen for several years. Because of this the work did not become an investigation of a new place, but experiencing
  a place anew, and memories of this place and of previous Torn Tracks works that were made in Bergen, have also found
  a place in the eventual work.<br>
  At the opening of the last Vestlandsutstillingen at Kunstgarasjen, Huizing will also do a performance in which she
  reflects on the works she made for this series of exhibitions. She'll lead the public through the works and places
  them in the context of the whole Torn Tracks project; how they relate to each other and the places; reorganizes parts;
  uses things that were not included and makes something new."</i></p>

<p style="color:#ccffcc";><strong><ins>NEW:</ins></strong> <a href="http://www.torntracks.com/stop_maps">Sketch Maps</a><br></p>
<p>In addition to the 6 new sound pieces, Huizing is developing the website as well. <em>Sketch maps</em> is a new
  way of searching the collection, where one track can have several side tracks or 'stops' you can listen to.
  More info on this view can be found on its own page. In the course of 2019/2020 this view will also be updated to a more
  complex version.</p>
