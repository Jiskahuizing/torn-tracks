<p style="color:#ccffcc";><strong><ins>FEATURED TRACK:</ins></strong> <a href="http://www.torntracks.com/stop_maps">Torn Tracks #19 - Bergen (12-17 July 2019)</a><br></p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vestlandsutstillingen/" target="_blank">Vestlandsutstillingen 2019</a>, Huizing is developing 6 site specific sound pieces for exhibitions in
  Ålesund, Haugesund, Øystese, Stavanger, Førde and Bergen.</p>
<p>Between 12-17 July 2019, she went on a site visit to Bergen to explore and record material for a
  new sound piece, the last one of this series of six. <em>Torn Tracks #19 - Bergen (12-17 July 2019)</em> premiered on
  the opening of the Vestlands exhibition at Kunstgarasjen in Bergen, on the 10th of October.</p>
<p><i>"The experience of Huizing's visit to Bergen was very different than the other 5 ones, because she has lived in
  Bergen for several years. Because of this the work did not become an investigation of a new place, but experiencing
  a place anew, and memories of this place and previous Torn Tracks works that were made in Bergen were also incorporated
  into the eventual work."</i></p>
